## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/gizmo/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup.md) is writeup for this project.

You're reading it!

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The code for this step is contained in the second code cell of the IPython notebook located in "./advanced_lane_finding.ipynb" (second code cell: lines 3 through 35).  

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:
![alt text][image6]

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image (thresholding steps in cell 2: lines 179 through 207). Note that the function generate_binary_image(img) was the result of experimentation seen in cell 3.  This involved experimentation of binary combinations of sobel gradient directions, gradient magnitudes, and color channels: RGB, HLS, and LAB.  The selected combination was a R and S color channels and gradient in x.   Here's an example of my output for this step.  

![alt text][image3]

The HLS colorspace was used to threshold based on Saturation as Saturation helped to cluster the white lane lines:

![alt text][image14]

The LAB colorspace was used to threshold based on Saturation as Saturation helped to cluster the yellow lane lines:

![alt text][image15]

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `perspective_transform()`, which appears in cell 2: lines 209 through 216 of the IPython notebook.  The `perspective_transform()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points based on the straight lane image, 'test_images/straight_lines1.jpg'.  Note that in the transformed image the difference between the left and right x points equals 700 pixels to match the conversion factor when converting the 3.7 meters into 700 pixels.  In actual implementation this difference was captured in variables such that the conversion factor will auto-adust if the transformed left and right x values were to be adjusted.

```python
perspective_src = np.float32(
    [[586.0, 456.5],
     [695.5, 456.5],
     [206., 720.],
     [1099., 720.]])
perspective_dst = np.float32(
    [[300.,  0.],
     [1000., 0.],
     [300.,  720.],
     [1000., 720.]])
```

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.  I tested this on a straight lane image and curved lane image.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

To identify the lane line I first computed a histogram based on the warped perspective of the binary combination image.  The histogram is shown for a curved image as shown here:

![alt text][image6]
![alt text][image8]

Using this histogram I locate the two highest peaks of this histogram representing the left and right lanes.  Using these peaks as a starting point for the lanes I apply a sliding window beginning at the bottom of the image and working my way up.  For each window I capture the indices for both left and right lane windows.

![alt text][image9]

I fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial as follows:

![alt text][image12]
![alt text][image11]

The fitted left and right line pixels were additionally stored in a FIFO queue so that the most recent, n_fifo, sets of left_fitx and right_fitx set of fitted "good" lines were always maintained.  "good" here means that the set of left and right lanes for a given frame passed a sanity check as defined by the min and max distance in meters between the two lane lines.  We compute this in the sanity() function of cell 2: lines 224 through 231.  One of the paramters is a percentage threshold that allows for deviation of the lane width by that percentage when determining sanity pass or fail criteria.

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I compute the curvature in meters in cell 14 in a function called, 'curvature_meters()'.
I computed the center offset in meters in cell 16 in a function called, 'center_offset()'.  A negative value is left of center and a postive value is right of center.

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in cell 18 lines 1 through 29.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

![alt text][image13]

As part of the pipeline cell 20 perform the above steps in the function process_image() which takes as input an image file that is fed in by VideoFileClip.fl_image() function.

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./output_images/project_video_output.mp4)

---

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

There are instances in the video output where the lane detection jumps around for a few frames as a result a white streak in the middle of the road that isn't a lane line.  This was addressed through the sanity() function in conjunction with the FIFO queue of left and right fitted pixels for each frame.  I settled on a FIFO queue length of 5 for both the left and right FIFO queues.  This was used in the pipeline code to with a threshold value of 0.24 (i.e. allowance for 24% deviation of lane width to the actual lane width of 3.7 meters).  When the sanity() check fails then the mean left and right pixels are computed from the FIFO queues and used as the fallback fitted left and right lane pixels for the failed frame.  24% was generous but helped to capture most deviations encountered by things such a whitish mark in the middle of the road that could some times be confused as a white lane.

Another way to address would be to track the previous lines and try to ensure the lines more or less remain parallel.  This was not done as it seems the approach of looking at the min and max distance thresholds were sufficient.

Another area of concern were situations where the yellow line appeared in sunny area where the pavement itself was also light in color.  It would sometimes be difficult to distinguish the yellow from the pavement.  However, by adjusting the Saturation channel threshold a little lower to (120, 255) which helped to reduce the effect of the pavement white and at the same time the B-channel threshold from the LAB colorspace was set to (180, 255) which also helped it distinguish the yellow line.

The combination of the FIFO queue fallback lines and the binary image thresholds served to prevent most of the spurious detections in the results.
